Consider the mass of the Earth. In decimal notation, we’d write this as
5972200000000000000000000 kg. That’s a really large number (too big to fit even in
an 8 byte integer).

In scientific notation, this would be written as 5.9722 x 10²⁴ kg, which is much
easier to read. Scientific notation has the added benefit of making it easier to
compare the magnitude of two extremely large or small numbers simply by comparing
the exponent.
Because it can be hard to type or display exponents in C++, we use the letter ‘e’
(or sometimes ‘E’) to represent the “times 10 to the power of” part of the
equation. For example, 1.2 x 10⁴ would be written as 1.2e4, and 5.9722 x 10²⁴ would
be written as 5.9722e24.
For numbers smaller than 1, the exponent can be negative. The number 5e-2 is
equivalent to 5 * 10⁻², which is 5 / 10², or 0.05. The mass of an electron is
9.1093837e-31 kg.



How to convert decimal numbers to scientific notation

Use the following procedure:
- Your exponent starts at zero.
- Slide the decimal left or right so there is only one non-zero digit to the left
of the decimal.
    - Each place you slide the decimal to the left increases the exponent by 1.
    - Each place you slide the decimal to the right decreases the exponent by 1.
- Trim off any leading zeros (on the left end of the significand)
- Trim off any trailing zeros (on the right end of the significand) only if the
original number had no decimal point. We’re assuming they’re not significant. If
you have additional information to suggest they are significant, you can keep them.

Here’s some examples:

Start with: 600.410
Slide decimal left 2 spaces: 6.00410e2
No leading zeros to trim: 6.00410e2
Don't trim trailing zeros: 6.00410e2 (6 significant digits)

Start with: 0.0078900
Slide decimal right 3 spaces: 0007.8900e-3
Trim leading zeros: 7.8900e-3
Don't trim trailing zeros: 7.8900e-3 (5 significant digits)

Start with: 42030 (no information to suggest the trailing zero is significant)
Slide decimal left 4 spaces: 4.2030e4
No leading zeros to trim: 4.2030e4
Trim trailing zeros: 4.203e4 (4 significant digits)

Start with: 42030 (assuming the trailing zero is significant)
Slide decimal left 4 spaces: 4.2030e4
No leading zeros to trim: 4.2030e4
Keep trailing zeros: 4.2030e4 (5 significant digits)



Handling trailing zeros

When converting to scientific notation, trailing zeros after a decimal are
considered significant, so we keep them:

87.0g = 8.70e1
87.000g = 8.7000e1
For numbers with no decimal point, trailing zeros are considered to be
insignificant by default. Given the number 2100 (with no additional information),
we assume the trailing 0s are not significant, so we drop them:

2100 = 2.1e3 (trailing zeros assumed not significant)
However, if we happened to know that this number was measured precisely (or that
the actual number was somewhere between 2099.5 and 2100.5), then we should instead
treat those zeros as significant:

2100 = 2.100e3 (trailing zeros known significant)
Tip
You may occasionally see a number written with a trailing decimal point. This is an
indication that the preceding zeros are significant.

2100. = 2.100e3 (trailing zeros known significant)
