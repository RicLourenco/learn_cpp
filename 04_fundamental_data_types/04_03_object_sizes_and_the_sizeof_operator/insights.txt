Key insight:
New programmers often focus too much on optimizing their code to use as little
memory as possible. In most cases, this makes a negligible difference. Focus on
writing maintainable code, and optimize only when and where the benefit will be
substantive


Some data types I wasn't familiar with:
Type            Min. size       Typical size
wchar_t	1       byte            2 or 4 bytes
char8_t	1       byte	        1 byte
char16_t        2 bytes	        2 bytes
char32_t	    4 bytes	        4 bytes
std::nullptr_t	4 bytes	        4 or 8 bytes

Tip:
For maximum portability, you shouldnâ€™t assume that objects are larger than the
specified minimum size.
Alternatively, if you want to assume that a type has some non-minimum size (e.g.
that an int is at least 4 bytes), you can use static_assert to have the compiler
fail a build if it is compiled on an architecture where this assumption is not true
